# HyperPlay Backend

The backend is developed in **C#** using the **.NET** framework. For data management, different database engines are used depending on the environment:

- In production, **MySQL** is used, ensuring optimal performance for large volumes of data.  
- In development, **SQLite** is employed, offering a lightweight and easy-to-configure solution for local testing.

## Deployment Infrastructure

The backend, along with the production database, is deployed on MonsterASP.
